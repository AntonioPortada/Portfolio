# Information of the project

Personal portfolio to showcase some projects where I have participated actively.
Also this project is going to be use for practicing the new things I am learning in this journey of work as a developer and when I have some free time.

This project is using the next technologies:
- [Angular](https://angular.dev) V19.2.0: This is a static page but I am using the best practices for angular development
- [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com): To deploy this app
- [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions): To use CI/CD for automatic deploy when I push to my repo

Currently I am using GitHub as the container for my repository, inside it, there is a tool called [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) and I am using it to deploy it.
GitHub also has [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions)
 Using the technologies that are in demand or the ones that I am learning
